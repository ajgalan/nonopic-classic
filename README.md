# NonoPic Classic
> A simple nonogram game for Android made with libGDX

## Information
NonoPic Classic is a puzzle game for Android that I handed in as a final degree project designed with libGDX and of which I have decided to release its code so that anyone can feel free to see its code or modify it.

The code is somewhat rudimentary, but the project should open in any recent version of Android Studio.

## Features
- 100 levels
- Interface adapted for (hopefully) the vast majority of mobile devices
- Persistent game progress
- Ability to resume games left unfinished
- Low weight of the application and relatively low resource usage
